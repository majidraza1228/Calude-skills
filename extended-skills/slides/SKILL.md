# Slides

Create zero-dependency HTML slide decks that run in the browser. Single HTML file, no build tools, no frameworks.

## Step 1: Clarifying questions

The user has told you what they want to present (via $ARGUMENTS or their message). Use AskUserQuestion to ask 4 questions in a single call. Always include questions 1-3, then pick 1 more based on context:

**Always ask:**

1. **"Do you have content ready, or just a topic?"**
   - Options: "I have content to paste" / "Just a topic, help me outline it"

2. **"How many slides?"**
   - Options: "Short (5-8)" / "Medium (10-15)" / "Long (20+)"

3. **"Which style?"**
   - Options: "Dark (default — black/yellow)" / "Light (Apple-clean)" / "Dark corporate"
   - **Dark is the default.** If the user has no preference, doesn't answer, or says "you pick," use the Dark style (STYLES.md section 0). Only fall back to another style when they ask for it.

**Pick 1 more from:**
- Will this be screen-shared in a video / recording? (If yes, use the larger "Designing for video / screen-share" sizes in STYLES.md and keep slides sparse.)
- What's the audience? (executives, developers, general public, etc.)
- What's the purpose? (pitch, teach, inform, inspire)
- Any specific content you want on the title slide?
- Do you have images or assets to include?
- What's the key takeaway the audience should remember?

If the user said "I have content to paste" — wait for them to paste it before continuing.

If the user asks to see style previews — generate single-slide preview files in `output/slide-previews/`, open them, and ask which they prefer. Then continue.

## Step 2: Online research

Use AskUserQuestion to ask:

**"Want me to research anything before I draft the slides?"**
- Options: "Yes, research the topic" / "Yes, let me tell you what to search" / "No, just build it"

If yes: search the web, summarize findings in 3-5 bullets, then continue.

## Image slides: layout rules

Two common failures when a slide centers on an image:

- **Constrain the image by height, not just width.** A full-bleed `width: 100%` image on a tall screenshot overflows a `100vh` slide and gets cropped. Always cap it: `max-height: 74vh; max-width: 100%; width: auto; height: auto; object-fit: contain;` and let the `<figure>` use `flex: 0 1 auto; min-height: 0;` so the title and image share the height. The whole image must be visible without scrolling.
- **Don't put a fade/reveal animation on an image that fills the slide.** A mid-transition screenshot looks washed out / semi-transparent. For image-centric slides, render the image statically at full opacity (skip the `.reveal` class on the `<figure>`).
- For a screenshot that already has its own background (e.g. a white table), let the image's own background show — don't wrap it in a contrasting card unless the user asks.
- **"Show the image" / showcase slides:** when the user just wants to display a screenshot they'll narrate over, make it a **pure full-bleed framed image — no on-slide title** (image centered, aspect preserved, subtle shadow). Exception: if the image is small (roughly < 700px on its long edge), use a **two-column** layout instead — image enlarged on the right half, a few words of large-text copy on the left, since a tiny image alone looks lost on a big slide.

## Step 3: Generate the deck

Read `STYLES.md` in this skill directory for the style reference. Generate a single self-contained HTML file following these rules:

**Structure:**
- Single HTML file with all CSS and JS inline
- Each slide is a `<section class="slide">` at exactly `100vh` / `100dvh`
- No scrolling within slides. If content overflows, split into multiple slides.
- `scroll-snap-type: y mandatory` for snapping between slides

**Content rules:**
- Title slide: **always use the Cover template** (STYLES.md → "Cover / title slide"). Lasso SVG + big full-width headline with one italic highlight word + optional subtitle. No kicker/eyebrow, no byline/footer. Only the title/subtitle change per deck.
- Content slides: 1 heading + max 5-6 bullets OR 1 heading + 2 short paragraphs
- Keep text concise. Slides are visual, not documents.

**Slide format variety — don't just use bullet lists for every slide. Use the 12 canonical formats in STYLES.md, and make sure every style supports all 12:**
- **Cover / title** — fixed spark mark, full-width headline, one highlighted word or phrase, optional subtitle.
- **Agenda** — single column, 3-4 numbered circles + bold label + 1-line description. Current item filled red, rest outlined.
- **Two-column** — left explanation, right real visual, mock, chart, screenshot, or animated illustration.
- **Stat grid** — 2-3 important numbers with short labels and context.
- **Feature grid** — bento/card grid with hand-built SVG icons, no emoji as the visual system.
- **Comparison** — structured side-by-side table or rows for before/after, us/them, option A/B.
- **Process / steps** — 3-4 animated illustration steps connected by arrows or a line.
- **Timeline / roadmap** — milestone cards with date, header, short description, and subtle ambient icon motion. No bare dot-only timelines.
- **Chart** — Chart.js stacked bar (P0), donut/pie (P1), line, or grouped bar. Monochrome tint ramp on `--accent`, hover tooltips, never rainbow.
- **Code block** — dark editor card with readable code, code-specific tokens, and one subtle cursor or scan animation.
- **Quote** — big quote plus attribution, with a portrait/logo/branded placeholder if the quote leaves too much blank space.
- **Closing / CTA** — spark mark, memorable closing line, and one clear next action.
- Use bullets for at most a third of the slides. The rest should use the canonical formats above.

**Design rules:**
- Every slide needs a visual element — text-only slides are forgettable. Use layout variety, cards, comparison boxes, or icons to add visual interest.
- Don't repeat the same layout on consecutive slides.
- Left-align body text. Only center titles and short hero text.
- Use emojis sparingly — a few as card icons in a recap grid is fine, not on every bullet.
- Commit to a visual motif and carry it across every slide (e.g., accent-colored dot bullets, card borders, same heading style).

**Avoid (common AI slide mistakes):**
- Accent lines or decorative bars under titles — hallmark of AI-generated slides
- Centering all body text
- Default blue accent on everything
- Putting the same bullet-list layout on every slide
- Generic gradients or glassmorphism without purpose

**Animations (include in all decks) — use the Animation Toolkit in STYLES.md:**
- Give most slides a subtle entrance: `.reveal` plus one variant (`from-left`, `from-right`, `from-scale`, `from-blur`, `fade-only`), or wrap a group in `.stagger`. The toolkit has a per-layout cheat-sheet — follow it.
- **One hero motion per slide**; everything else just fades. Subtle = 8–24px travel, 450–700ms, ease-out. Never distracting.
- Use `data-count` for big stats, `.draw-line` instead of a static accent line, and `.float`/`.pulse` only on a single small decorative element (never text).
- Image-only slides get a single `fade-only` or no animation at all.
- **Animated illustrations** are the signature move: for process/step slides and concept slides, build inline-SVG illustrations with looping ambient motion (breathing glow, self-writing line, twinkle, drift, flowing connector). See "Animated Illustrations" in STYLES.md, including the **process-flow template** (big title only — no eyebrow, no step numbers — large bold step headlines, animated disc per step). Hold to the **illustration quality bar** there: hand-built SVG with one cohesive visual language, style palette only, refined not clip-art — never emoji/stock glyphs as the centerpiece.
- Always keep the `prefers-reduced-motion` block (the toolkit disables all motion under it).

Note: the Visual QA renderer (Step 5) freezes animations to their final state, so QA shows the resting layout — verify motion separately by opening the deck.

**Navigation (include in all decks):**
- Arrow keys (left/right and up/down)
- Space bar to advance
- Scroll / swipe
- Progress bar at top
- Navigation dots on the right edge

**Responsive:**
- All font sizes use `clamp(min, preferred, max)`
- All spacing uses `clamp()` or viewport units
- Height breakpoints at 700px, 600px, 500px
- Hide decorative elements on very short screens

## Step 4: Save

Save the file to `output/slides/[deck-name].html` using a short, descriptive kebab-case name. Do **not** open it for the user yet — first run Visual QA (Step 5).

## Step 5: Visual QA (REQUIRED — do not skip)

You cannot tell whether a deck looks right by reading the HTML. Rendered slides routinely have problems the code doesn't reveal: images cropped by the viewport, text washed out by downscaling, elements overlapping, captures taken mid-animation, low contrast. **Always render and inspect before declaring done.** This step is mandatory even for a single slide.

**1. Render each slide to an image:**
```bash
/usr/bin/python3 ~/.claude/skills/slides/render_slides.py --html output/slides/<deck>.html
```
This prints one image path per line (into `output/slides/qa/slide-NN.png`). It isolates each slide, disables scroll-snap, and forces final (non-animated) state, so you see exactly what renders.

**2. Inspect with a fresh-eyes subagent.** Do NOT inspect them yourself — you've been staring at the code and will see what you expect, not what's there. Spawn a subagent (Agent tool, `general-purpose`) and pass it the image paths plus a one-line "expected" note per slide. Use this prompt:

> Visually inspect these slide images. Assume there are issues — find them. For each slide, list problems (even minor): overlapping elements, text overflow or cut off at edges, images cropped or only partially visible, low-contrast text/icons (light-on-light, dark-on-dark), washed-out or faded images, mid-animation/half-faded captures, footers or citations colliding with content, uneven or cramped gaps (<0.3"), insufficient margin from slide edges (<0.5"), columns not aligned, leftover placeholder text. Report ALL issues with the slide number. If a slide looks clean, say so explicitly.
> Read and analyze:
> 1. <path>/slide-01.png (Expected: <brief description>)
> 2. ...

**3. Fix every real issue**, then **re-render the affected slides and re-inspect** — one fix often creates another problem (e.g. enlarging an image re-crops it).

**4. Repeat until a full pass finds nothing new.** Do not declare success until you've completed at least one fix-and-verify cycle. If the first pass "finds nothing," look again more critically — there is almost always something on the first draft.

## Step 6: Deliver

Only after QA passes:
- Open the file with `open <filepath>` so the user can view it
- Tell the user where it was saved and give a one-line summary of the QA pass (e.g. "rendered all 8 slides, fixed 2 overflow issues, re-verified clean")
- Mention they can customize colors by editing the `:root` CSS variables at the top
- Clean up the `output/slides/qa/` images if no longer needed
